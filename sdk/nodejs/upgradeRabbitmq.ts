/**
 * This resource allows you to upgrade RabbitMQ version. Depending on initial versions of RabbitMQ and
 * Erlang of the CloudAMQP instance, multiple runs may be needed to get to the latest or wanted version.
 * Reason for this is certain supported RabbitMQ version will also automatically upgrade Erlang version.
 *
 * There is three different ways to trigger the version upgrade
 *
 * > * Specify RabbitMQ version to upgrade to
 * > * Upgrade to latest RabbitMQ version
 * > * Old behaviour to upgrade to latest RabbitMQ version
 *
 * See example below for usage.
 *
 * Only available for dedicated subscription plans running ***RabbitMQ***.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * <details>
 *   <summary>
 *     <b>
 *       <i>Specify version upgrade, from [v1.31.0]</i>
 *     </b>
 *   </summary>
 *
 * Specify the version to upgrade to. List available upgradable versions, use
 * [CloudAMQP API available versions].
 *
 * After the upgrade finished, there can still be newer versions available.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as cloudamqp from "@pulumi/cloudamqp";
 *
 * const instance = new cloudamqp.Instance("instance", {
 *     name: "rabbitmq-version-upgrade-test",
 *     plan: "bunny-1",
 *     region: "amazon-web-services::us-west-1",
 * });
 * const upgrade = new cloudamqp.UpgradeRabbitmq("upgrade", {
 *     instanceId: instance.id,
 *     newVersion: "3.13.2",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * </details>
 *
 * <details>
 *   <summary>
 *     <b>
 *       <i>Upgrade to latest possible version, from [v1.31.0]</i>
 *     </b>
 *   </summary>
 *
 * This will upgrade RabbitMQ to the latest possible version detected by the data source
 * `cloudamqp.getUpgradableVersions`. Multiple runs can be needed to upgrade the version even further.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as cloudamqp from "@pulumi/cloudamqp";
 *
 * const instance = new cloudamqp.Instance("instance", {
 *     name: "rabbitmq-version-upgrade-test",
 *     plan: "bunny-1",
 *     region: "amazon-web-services::us-west-1",
 * });
 * const upgradableVersions = instance.id.apply(id => cloudamqp.getUpgradableVersionsOutput({
 *     instanceId: id,
 * }));
 * const upgrade = new cloudamqp.UpgradeRabbitmq("upgrade", {
 *     instanceId: instance.id,
 *     currentVersion: instance.rmqVersion,
 *     newVersion: upgradableVersions.apply(upgradableVersions => upgradableVersions.newRabbitmqVersion),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * </details>
 *
 * <details>
 *   <summary>
 *     <b>
 *       <i>Upgrade to latest possible version, before v1.31.0</i>
 *     </b>
 *   </summary>
 *
 * Old behaviour of the upgrading the RabbitMQ version. No longer recommended.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as cloudamqp from "@pulumi/cloudamqp";
 *
 * // Retrieve latest possible upgradable versions for RabbitMQ and Erlang
 * const versions = cloudamqp.getUpgradableVersions({
 *     instanceId: instance.id,
 * });
 * // Invoke automatically upgrade to latest possible upgradable versions for RabbitMQ and Erlang
 * const upgrade = new cloudamqp.UpgradeRabbitmq("upgrade", {instanceId: instance.id});
 * ```
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as cloudamqp from "@pulumi/cloudamqp";
 *
 * // Retrieve latest possible upgradable versions for RabbitMQ and Erlang
 * const versions = cloudamqp.getUpgradableVersions({
 *     instanceId: instance.id,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * If newer version is still available to be upgradable in the data source, re-run again.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as cloudamqp from "@pulumi/cloudamqp";
 *
 * // Retrieve latest possible upgradable versions for RabbitMQ and Erlang
 * const versions = cloudamqp.getUpgradableVersions({
 *     instanceId: instance.id,
 * });
 * // Invoke automatically upgrade to latest possible upgradable versions for RabbitMQ and Erlang
 * const upgrade = new cloudamqp.UpgradeRabbitmq("upgrade", {instanceId: instance.id});
 * ```
 *
 * </details>
 *
 * ## Important upgrade information
 *
 * > * All single node upgrades will require some downtime since RabbitMQ needs a restart.
 * > * From RabbitMQ version 3.9, rolling upgrades between minor versions (e.g. 3.9 to 3.10), in a
 * >       multi-node cluster are possible without downtime. This means that one node is upgraded at a time
 * >       while the other nodes are still running. For versions older than 3.9, patch version upgrades
 * >       (e.g. 3.8.x to 3.8.y) are possible without downtime in a multi-node cluster, but minor version
 * >       upgrades will require downtime.
 * > * Auto delete queues (queues that are marked AD) will be deleted during the update.
 * > * Any custom plugins support has installed on your behalf will be disabled and you need to contact
 * >       support@cloudamqp.com and ask to have them re-installed.
 * > * TLS 1.0 and 1.1 will not be supported after the update.
 *
 * ## Multiple runs
 *
 * Depending on initial versions of RabbitMQ and Erlang of the CloudAMQP instance, multiple runs may be
 * needed to get to the latest or wanted version.
 *
 * Example steps needed when starting at RabbitMQ version 3.12.2
 *
 * |  Version         | Supported upgrading versions              | Min version to upgrade Erlang |
 * |------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
 * | 3.12.2           | 3.12.4, 3.12.6, 3.12.10, 3.12.12, 3.12.13 | 3.12.13                       |
 * | 3.12.13          | 3.13.2                                    | 3.13.2                        |
 * | 3.13.2           | -                                         | -                             |
