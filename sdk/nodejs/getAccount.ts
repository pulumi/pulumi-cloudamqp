/**
 * Use this data source to retrieve basic information about all instances available for an account. Uses the included apikey in provider configuration, to determine which account to read from.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Can be used in other resources/data sources when instance identifier is unknown, while other attributes are known. E.g. find correct instance from `instance name`. Then iterate over instances to find the matching one and extract the instance identifier.
 *
 * <!--Start PulumiCodeChooser -->
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as cloudamqp from "@pulumi/cloudamqp";
 *
 * const instanceName = "<instance_name>";
 * const instanceList = cloudamqp.getAccount({});
 * export const instanceId = <nil>;
 * ```
 * <!--End PulumiCodeChooser -->
 *
 * ## Attributes reference
 *
 * All attributes reference are computed
 *
 * * `id`          - The identifier for this data source. Set to `na` since there is no unique identifier.
 * * `instances`   - An array of instances. Each `instances` block consists of the fields documented below.
 *
 * ***
 *
 * The `instances` block consist of
 *
 * * `id`      - The instance identifier.
 * * `name`    - The name of the instance.
 * * `plan`    - The subscription plan used for the instance.
 * * `region`  - The region were the instanece is located in.
 * * `tags`    - Optional tags set for the instance.
 *
 * ## Dependency
 *
 * This data source depends on apikey set in the provider configuration.
