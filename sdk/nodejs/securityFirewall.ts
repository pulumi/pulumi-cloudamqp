/**
 * This resource allows you to configure and manage firewall rules for the CloudAMQP instance.
 *
 * > **WARNING:** Firewall rules applied with this resource will replace any existing firewall rules.
 * Make sure all wanted rules are present to not lose them.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** From [v1.33.0] when destroying this resource the firewall on the servers will also be
 * removed. I.e. the firewall will be completely closed.
 *
 * Only available for dedicated subscription plans.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as cloudamqp from "@pulumi/cloudamqp";
 *
 * const _this = new cloudamqp.SecurityFirewall("this", {
 *     instanceId: instance.id,
 *     rules: [
 *         {
 *             ip: "192.168.0.0/24",
 *             ports: [
 *                 4567,
 *                 4568,
 *             ],
 *             services: [
 *                 "AMQP",
 *                 "AMQPS",
 *                 "HTTPS",
 *             ],
 *         },
 *         {
 *             ip: "10.56.72.0/24",
 *             ports: [],
 *             services: [
 *                 "AMQP",
 *                 "AMQPS",
 *                 "HTTPS",
 *             ],
 *         },
 *         {
 *             ip: "192.168.1.10/32",
 *             ports: [],
 *             services: [
 *                 "AMQP",
 *                 "AMQPS",
 *                 "HTTPS",
 *             ],
 *         },

 * CloudAMQP Terraform provider [v1.27.0] enables faster `cloudamqp.Instance` destroy when running
 * `terraform destroy`.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as cloudamqp from "@pulumi/cloudamqp";
 *
 * const instance = new cloudamqp.Instance("instance", {
 *     name: "terraform-cloudamqp-instance",
 *     plan: "penguin-1",
 *     region: "amazon-web-services::us-west-1",
 *     tags: ["terraform"],

 *         {
 *             ip: "0.0.0.0/0",

 *             services: [
 *                 "AMQP",

 *
 * ## Dependency
 *
 * This resource depends on CloudAMQP instance identifier, `cloudamqp_instance.instance.id`.
 *
 * If used together with [VPC GPC peering], see additional information.
 *
 * ## Known issues
 *
 * <details>
 *   <summary>Custom ports trigger new update every time</summary>
 *
 *   Before release v1.15.1 using the custom ports can cause a missmatch upon reading data and
 *   trigger a new update every time.
 *
 *   Reason is that there is a bug in validating the response from the underlying API.
 *
 *   Update the provider to at least [v1.15.1] to fix the issue.
 *  </details>
 *
 * <details>
 *   <summary>Using pre-defined service port in ports</summary>
 *
 * Using one of the port from the pre-defined services in ports argument, see example of using port
 * 5671 instead of the service *AMQPS*.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as cloudamqp from "@pulumi/cloudamqp";
 *
 * const firewallSettings = new cloudamqp.SecurityFirewall("firewall_settings", {
 *     instanceId: instance.id,
 *     rules: [{
 *         ip: "192.168.0.0/24",
 *         ports: [5671],
 *         services: [],
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Will still create the firewall rule for the instance, but will trigger a new update each `plan` or
 * `apply`. Due to a missmatch between state file and underlying API response.
 *
 * To solve this, edit the configuration file and change port 5671 to service *AMQPS* and run
 * `pulumi up -refresh-only` to only update the state file and remove the missmatch.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as cloudamqp from "@pulumi/cloudamqp";
 *
 * const firewallSettings = new cloudamqp.SecurityFirewall("firewall_settings", {
 *     instanceId: instance.id,
 *     rules: [{
 *         ip: "192.168.0.0/24",
 *         ports: [],
 *         services: ["AMQPS"],
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The provider from [v1.15.2] will start to warn about using this.
